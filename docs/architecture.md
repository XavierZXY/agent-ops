# Log Monitoring Agent Architecture Design

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for a GPT-powered log monitoring agent system. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and fault-tolerant, with seamless integration of GPT capabilities for intelligent log analysis and processing.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Manager
The central coordinator of the system that manages communication with GPT API and orchestrates other components.

#### Key Responsibilities:
- GPT API integration and communication management
- Request/response handling and queueing
- Rate limiting and token management
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Component lifecycle management

### 2. Log Processing Pipeline

#### 2.1 Log Collectors
- File system watchers for local logs
- Network collectors for remote logs
- Application-specific log adapters
- Buffer management for high-throughput scenarios

#### 2.2 Log Processors
- Format normalization
- Timestamp standardization
- Field extraction and enrichment
- Initial filtering and categorization

#### 2.3 Log Analyzers
- GPT-powered pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection
- Correlation analysis
- Severity assessment

### 3. Service Layer

#### 3.1 API Gateway
- RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Request validation

#### 3.2 Service Handlers
- Configuration management
- Query processing
- Alert management
- Report generation

## Data Flow

1. Log Collection Flow:
   ```
   Log Sources → Collectors → Buffer → Processors → Analyzers → Storage
   ```

2. Analysis Flow:
   ```
   Raw Logs → Normalization → GPT Analysis → Enrichment → Alert Generation
   ```

3. API Flow:
   ```
   Client Request → API Gateway → Service Handler → Component Interaction → Response
   ```
