# Multi-Agent System Development Tasks

## 1. Project Setup

- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Install required dependencies (metagpt, openai, etc.)
- [x] Configure environment variables for API tokens

## 2. Agent Architecture Design

- [x] Define agent base class with common functionality
- [x] Design communication protocol between agents
- [x] Create agent workflow diagram

## 3. Agent Implementation

- [x] Implement Security Agent
  - Monitor logs for anomalies
  - Send alerts to Admin Agent when issues are found
- [x] Implement Admin Agent
  - Receive reports from Security Agent
  - Analyze issues and decide which response agent to dispatch
  - Forward requests to appropriate agent (Police or Firefighter)
- [x] Implement Firefighter Agent
  - Receive and process requests from Admin Agent
  - Handle fire-related issues
- [x] Implement Police Agent
  - Receive and process requests from Admin Agent
  - Handle security-related issues

## 4. Log Monitoring System

- [x] Create sample log generator for testing
- [x] Implement log parsing mechanism
- [x] Define rules for anomaly detection

## 5. Agent Communication

- [x] Implement message passing between agents
- [x] Define message format and structure
- [x] Create message queue or communication channel

## 6. System Integration

- [x] Connect all agents within a main application
- [x] Implement startup and shutdown procedures
- [x] Create configuration management

## 7. Testing

- [x] Create unit tests for each agent
- [x] Develop integration tests for the entire system
- [x] Test with various anomaly scenarios

## 8. Documentation

- [ ] Document system architecture
- [ ] Create usage instructions
- [ ] Add API documentation for future extensions

## 9. Demo Preparation

- [x] Create demonstration script
- [x] Prepare example scenarios
- [ ] Create visualization of agent interactions (optional)
